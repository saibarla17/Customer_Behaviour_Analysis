🔍 Analytical Workflow
1. Data Preparation & Exploration (Python)

Loaded and explored raw retail transaction data

Handled missing values using category-level imputation

Standardized column naming conventions

Created derived features such as age groups and purchase frequency

Validated data consistency and removed redundant fields

Loaded the cleaned dataset into a SQL database for analysis

2. Business Analysis (SQL)

Key business questions addressed using SQL:

Revenue comparison by gender

Identification of high-spending customers using discounts

Top-rated and most frequently purchased products

Shipping type impact on average purchase value

Subscriber vs. non-subscriber spending behavior

Discount dependency by product

Customer segmentation into New, Returning, and Loyal groups

Revenue contribution by age group

3. Visualization & Reporting (Power BI)

An interactive dashboard was built to visualize:
